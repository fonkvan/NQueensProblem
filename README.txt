Hello, there are many ways you can run my code! 
Running on Tesla:
1) Download FileZilla or some other file pusher
1b) You can also clone the repository from my public github repo using https://github.com/fonkvan/NQueensProblem.git
2) Sign in to your tesla account on that app (sftp://username@tesla.cs.iupui.edu on FileZilla) and move all files over.
3) Open project in Tesla, then type `make Solution` and then `make run` to run the program. Should work for any value of N, but beyond 25 solve time does take awhile.

Run with Visual Studio:
1) Open the project in Visual Studio
2) Create a solution file
3) Press the green 'play'/debugger button.
